# About me

## Who am I?

My name is Luka Ljubojević (21 M). I'm a full-time student at Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies - Rijeka, Croatia, first year of the masters graduate study.

I possess knowledge in Computer Networks, Computer Systems Architecture, Network Operating Systems, Operating Systems in general, Managing Computer Systems, IT Systems Security, relational databases (Oracle), and I understand the basics of programming (Python and C++).

I have experience in: Docker Containers, Automatization tools, Cloud IaS instances, Virtualization, Bash scripting, Caching systems, Load balancers, Web servers, Relational databases, Managing CDN systems, GitHub.

Also, non-related to this brach, I gained some knowledge in: Data and Database modeling, Algorithms, Object-oriented programming, Web programming (frontend and backend) and IT Project Management.

Currently a Junior CDN Administrator.

## How it all started?

Since elementary school I have been researching computer hardware and operating systems. I first learned to assemble computers and then I discovered how to properly install an operating system.
Later, I continuted playing with operating systems and found about virtual machines (VMWare, Oracle Virtualbox). I found that I like spending time playing with virtual machines so i tried installing and configuring various Linux distros, Windows Server editions, misc and retro operating systems like ReactOS, OS/2, DOS, etc.

I decided to attend a technical high school - CS courses. There I learned about IT, programming, Computer networks, hardware, etc.
I continued my path into IT by enrolling in Informatics at the University of Rijeka - Faculty of Informatics and Digital Technologies. There I went deeper into Computer Networks, Security, Managing Linux Systems, Programming in C++, Web development, Project management, Multimedia, etc. I plan to continue my master study.

## What is my motivation?

In the second year of study I attended some System specific courses and discovered the job System Administrator and scope of his/her work. I found myself in that role so I started to learn what is needed to become one.

This site is a by-product of my specialization in the System Administration field, I shared it for other students, my colleagues, who would like to be System Administrators but don't know where to start.

Special thanks to my professor [doc. dr. sc. Vedran Miletić](https://vedran.miletic.net/) @ [gaseri](https://gaseri.org) for all the help he provided.
